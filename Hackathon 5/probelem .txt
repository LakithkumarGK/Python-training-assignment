Data Analysis of Heart Disease Dataset 
The Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository is a widely-used 
dataset in medical data analysis. It contains information about various health-related 
attributes of patients and whether they have heart disease or not. 
Features in the Heart Disease Dataset: 
The dataset consists of several columns (features), including: 
1. Age: Age of the patient. 
2. Sex: Gender of the patient (1 = male, 0 = female). 
3. ChestPainType: Type of chest pain (4 categories: typical angina, atypical angina, 
non-anginal pain, asymptomatic). 
4. RestingBP: Resting blood pressure. 
5. Cholesterol: Serum cholesterol level (in mg/dl). 
6. FBS: Fasting blood sugar (1 = true, 0 = false). 
7. RestingECG: Resting electrocardiographic results (values like normal, ST-T wave 
abnormality, left ventricular hypertrophy). 
8. MaxHR: Maximum heart rate achieved. 
9. ExerciseAngina: Whether the patient has exercise-induced angina (1 = yes, 0 = 
no). 
10. Oldpeak: Depression induced by exercise relative to rest. 
11. Slope: Slope of the peak exercise ST segment (3 categories). 
12. Ca: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (0-3). 
13. Thal: Thalassemia (3 categories: normal, fixed defect, reversible defect). 
14. Target: Whether the patient has heart disease (1 = yes, 0 = no). 
Task 1: Load and Inspect the Data (15-20 minutes) 
 Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. 
 Use basic inspection techniques: 
o df.head() to view the first few rows. 
o df.describe() to get statistical summaries. 
o df.info() to check for missing values and data types. 
 Check the distribution of the target variable (Target). 
Task 2: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (25-30 minutes) 
 Handle Missing Data: 
o Check for missing values (df.isnull().sum()). 
o If any columns have missing values, discuss strategies for handling them 
(e.g., filling with mean/median, or dropping rows). 
 Feature Engineering: 
o Convert categorical variables like Sex, ChestPainType, RestingECG, etc., 
into numeric format using encoding (e.g., one-hot encoding or label 
encoding). 
o Normalize or standardize numerical columns if necessary (e.g., 
RestingBP, Cholesterol, MaxHR). 
 Create New Features: 
o Example: Combine Oldpeak and Slope to create a new feature that 
represents "exercise-induced heart stress". 
Task 3: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (30-40 minutes) 
 Univariate Analysis: 
o Plot the distribution of key numerical features (e.g., Age, Cholesterol, 
MaxHR) using histograms or boxplots. 
o Visualize the distribution of the target variable (Target), using a count plot. 
 Bivariate Analysis: 
o Explore the relationship between the target variable (Target) and other 
features: 
 Use a count plot or bar plot for categorical features like Sex, 
ChestPainType, FBS, ExerciseAngina. 
 Use a boxplot or violin plot for numerical features like Age, 
Cholesterol, MaxHR to see how they relate to heart disease 
presence. 
 Correlation matrix to explore relationships between numeric 
features. 
 Visualizing correlations: 
o Visualize correlations using a heatmap (sns.heatmap), focusing on 
relationships between features like cholesterol, age, and resting blood 
pressure. 
Task 4: Aggregation and Insights (20 minutes) 
 Use groupby to find the survival rate (presence of heart disease) by diƯ erent 
categories: 
o Survival by gender (Male vs Female). 
o Survival by chest pain type (ChestPainType). 
o Survival by maximum heart rate achieved (MaxHR). 
 Calculate average cholesterol levels for people with and without heart disease, 
and compare these across categories (e.g., ChestPainType). 
Task 5: Derive Medical Insights 
 Investigate the data set and come up with at least 5 diƯ erent insights with proof
 Prepare a dashboard for your findings
